# Guarantees and Limitations

VAYS itself needs very little configuration. Most of it is done automatically on the
clientside using the data that is provided by YAC - and its configuration.
However, the frontend does have some limitations with how much it can actually display.
For example, VAYS guarantees that up to four favorite actions can be displayed well
across all screens. If YAC is configured to provide more, they will be displayed - but the UX for some users will suffer.

The following guidelines exist:

- Favorite Actions: No more than 4 favorite actions should be displayed. 5 is in the grey zone. If possible, try to move less important (less used) actions out of the favorites.

- Number of columns in the table: Here, it is advised to no more than 8 columns in total.
